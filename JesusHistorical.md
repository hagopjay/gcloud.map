Below is a copy-/paste-ready Mermaid diagram that walks through (almost) every major + minor episode in the earthly life of Jesus, from the first annunciations to Pentecost.  
• Events are sequenced top → bottom (TD = “top-down”).  
• Each node contains a date or span and micro-notes wrapped in `<small>` tags—perfect for zooming or shrinking when you print the SVG.  
• Colored clusters help students see the five traditional “acts.”  
Feel free to trim, recolor, or add more verses!

Printing Tips  
1. Paste into a Mermaid live editor (e.g., https://mermaid.live) → “Download as SVG.”  
2. Open SVG in Illustrator / Inkscape, set width to your poster size (A2, A1, etc.).  
3. Because details are in `<small>` tags, they stay legible even when the overall artwork is shrunk to fit the wall.  
4. Want diagonal arrows for “prophecies fulfilled” or links to Roman history? Add dashed arrows like  
   `J22 -. Roman Governance .-> J7`  

Historical Notes & Caveats  
• Exact years (Nativity 5/4 BCE, Crucifixion AD 30 or 33) reflect common scholarly ranges—footnote them if precision matters.  
• Quirinius census and calendar gaps are hotly debated; mark with * or QR codes leading to deeper reading.
